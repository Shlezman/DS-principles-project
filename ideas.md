## üì∞ Idea 4: News Headline & Body Evolution

**Domain:** News Trends / Clickbait Analysis  
**What to collect:**
- News articles over time, focusing on headlines vs. full content.
- Fields: title, body, publication time, author, source, update history.

**Why it works:**
- Allows you to study how news evolves over time (bias, sensationalism)
- Headlines often change post-publication

**Tools:**
- `newspaper3k`, RSS feeds, `scrapy`, or custom cron job crawlers
- `difflib` or `Levenshtein` distance to compare versions

**Challenges:**
- Storing diffs over time
- Dealing with duplicate content across syndication

---

## üß† Idea 5: StackOverflow Post Lifecycle

**Domain:** Knowledge Platforms / Community Behavior  
**What to collect:**
- Questions, answers, edits, votes, and comment timelines.
- Fields: tags, accepted answer, edit timestamps, vote counts

**Why it works:**
- Non-trivial structure: temporal, social, revision-based
- Ideal for studying crowd-sourced knowledge validation

**Tools:**
- StackExchange API via `stackapi`
- `pandas`, `networkx` (for relationships)
- Historical versioning available

**Challenges:**
- API throttling
- Complex nested comment chains

## üß¨ Idea 6: COVID-19 or Influenza Case Trends

**Domain:** Medicine / Epidemiology  
**What to collect:**
- Daily case numbers by region, death rates, hospitalizations, vaccination stats.
- Fields: country/state, cases, deaths, date, positivity rate

**Why it works:**
- Dense time-series data with global geographic scope
- Real-world health impact data

**Sources:**
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
- [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/), [WHO](https://covid19.who.int/)

**Tools:**
- Public APIs + CSV scrapers
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

**Challenges:**
- Varying formats across sources
- Backlogged or corrected data

## üê¶ Idea 7: Bird Migration and Sightings

**Domain:** Ecology / Animal Behavior  
**What to collect:**
- Species sightings with coordinates, time, and observation notes.
- Fields: species, latitude, longitude, date, observer ID, count

**Why it works:**
- Spatiotemporal movement patterns are highly structured
- Can integrate with maps and environmental overlays

**Sources:**
- [eBird API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/ebird-api-20/2HTbHW)
- [iNaturalist](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/)

**Tools:**
- `requests`, `geopandas`, `folium` or `leaflet.js` for mapping

**Challenges:**
- Need filtering for duplicates and spam
- Requires region focus for large-scale scraping

---

## üå± Idea 8: Plant Phenology (Seasonal Patterns)

**Domain:** Climate Biology / Botany  
**What to collect:**
- First bloom dates, fruiting times, or leaf coloration across species
- Fields: plant species, region, phenological phase, timestamp

**Why it works:**
- Seasonal and climate-driven data
- Strong signals for forecasting models

**Sources:**
- [USA National Phenology Network](https://www.usanpn.org/)
- [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)

**Tools:**
- `requests`, `pandas`, `datetime`, `geopandas`

**Challenges:**
- Sparse records for some species/regions
- Regional climate normalization

## üêõ Idea 9: Insect Biodiversity and Abundance Logs

**Domain:** Entomology / Biodiversity  
**What to collect:**
- Observations of bees, butterflies, moths, or mosquitos by location and time.
- Fields: species, count, date, location, observer, notes

**Why it works:**
- Species monitoring + seasonality + location
- Can be used to model biodiversity shifts or outbreaks

**Sources:**
- [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary)
- [iNaturalist](https://api.inaturalist.org/)

**Tools:**
- GBIF API, GeoJSON + `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `leaflet.js`

**Challenges:**
- Duplicated records
- Observer bias (over/underreporting)

## üåç Idea 10: Ecological Forecasting: Species + Weather

**Domain:** Environmental Modeling / Ecology  
**What to collect:**
- Combine animal/plant sightings with weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind)
- Fields: species, timestamp, location + weather data at the same time

**Why it works:**
- Complex multivariate dataset
- Can build predictive models (e.g., bird migration vs. wind patterns)

**Sources:**
- eBird or iNaturalist + [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

**Tools:**
- `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `folium`

**Challenges:**
- Synchronizing different data sources
- Timezone and geo-resolution mismatch
